Developer Student Clubs (DSC) are university-based community groups, built by students, for students interested in Google Developer technologies. This club is designed for all levels, from beginners to experts and aims to bridge the theoretical to practical knowledge gap through workshops, and community outreach projects. By joining a DSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.
